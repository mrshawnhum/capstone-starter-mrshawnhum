# React Student Starter

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Live site

Here is the active site posted with Netlify(currently in construction due to API issue) - [Find My Rescue](https://5f03491bd130dc6040c755e6--objective-aryabhata-f2e297.netlify.app/)

## Frontend Disclaimer

Some images will be the same photo as the api would not include photos for some animals. When there is no image, a placeholder from Unsplash will be included instead.

## 'backend' üìÅ

You will need to `cd` into this folder and run `npm i`. The 'backend' has its own 'package.json'.

In there, you can do `npm run server` to fire up a server on port `5000`.


## Available Front-End Scripts

**Run `yarn`. _Do not_ use `npm` as it can lead to some unnecessary conflicts from `yarn` and `npm`.**

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.
